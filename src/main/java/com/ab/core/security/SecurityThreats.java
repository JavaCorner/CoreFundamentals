 * Security Threats
 *      DoS Attacks
 *      Sensitive data leaks
 *      Code corruption
 *      Code injection
 *
 * Denial of Service Attacks
 *      Unchecked and unrestricted resource utilization can be exploited
 * Prevention:
 *      Use permission to restrict access to code that consumes vulnerable resource
 *      Validate all aplication inputs
 *      Release resources in all cases
 *      Monitor excessive resource consumption
 *
 * Best practices for protecting code
 *      Enforce tight encapsulation
 *      Make objects as immutable as possible
 *      Do not break subclass assumption about inherited code
 *      Design classes and methods for inheritance or declare them final
 *      protect byte code against tempering and dangerous behaviour
